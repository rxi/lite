## Overview
lite is a lightweight text editor written mostly in Lua — it aims to provide
something practical, pretty, *small* and fast, implemented as simply as
possible; easy to modify and extend, or to use without doing either.

## Customization
Additional functionality can be added through plugins which are available from
the [plugins repository](https://github.com/rxi/lite-plugins); additional color
themes can be found in the [colors repository](https://github.com/rxi/lite-colors).
The editor can be customized by making changes to the
[user module](data/user/init.lua).

## Building

### Linux

You can build the project yourself on Linux with following prerequisites:

 * GCC
 * Simple DirectMedia Layer development files

#### Debian/Ubuntu

```
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev gcc make
make
sudo make install PREFIX=/usr/local
```

### Windows

Using the `build.bat` script *([MinGW](https://nuwen.net/mingw.html) is required)*.
Note that the project does not need to be rebuilt if you are only making changes
to the Lua portion of the code.

## Contributing
Any additional functionality that can be added through a plugin should be done
so as a plugin, after which a pull request to the
[plugins repository](https://github.com/rxi/lite-plugins) can be made. In hopes
of remaining lightweight, pull requests adding additional functionality to the
core will likely not be merged. Bug reports and bug fixes are welcome.
